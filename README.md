PORTFOLIO.

Previously a teacher and computing coordinator, I recently chose to change mycareer and was selected to participate in an intensive 16 week bootcamp withSchool of Code. During this time, I learnt full stack development and agilelearning amongst a number of other skills that would prepare me for a role at ajunior developer. My previous experience in the education sector has allowed meto enhance my communication skills, both face to face and through a variety ofwritten forms, both with colleagues and the public. I draw great satisfaction fromworking as part of a team to provide solutions to problems. More recently, I havebecome increasingly interested in front-end development and user experiencesof websites and applications and would relish the opportunity develop myknowledge and expertise in the field in the future.
